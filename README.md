# Strobe Light App

## How to use this app:
1. Visit exp://expo.io/@jswill88/strobe-light+wligmOhDK on a mobile device, and open the app with Expo
2. Give the app permission to use your camera
3. Click "Start" to see your camera flash go on and off
4. Click "Stop" to stop the flashing
5. Move the slider, or press 'Slower' and 'Faster' to change the speed of the flash

I don't know if this works on Android, but it works on iPhone
