# Strobe Light App

How to use this app:
1. Visit https://snack.expo.io/@jswill88/strobe-light
2. Scan the QR code under "My Device" on the right hand panel, and open the app with Expo
3. Give the app permission to use your camera
4. Click "Start the Strobe" to see your camera flash go on and off
5. Click "Stop the Strobe" to stop the flashing

I don't know if this works on Android, but it works on iPhone
